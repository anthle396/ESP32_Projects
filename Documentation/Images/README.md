# LED and Speaker Control with Button - STM32 Project

This project demonstrates basic GPIO control using an STM32 microcontroller. It controls three LEDs (Red, Green, Blue) and a speaker, with a push button used as user input.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Setup

| Component   | GPIO Pin | Label |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Red LED     | GPIO 13  | D13   |
| Green LED   | GPIO 12  | D12   |
| Blue LED    | GPIO 27  | D27   |
| Speaker     | GPIO 21  | D21   |
| Push Button | GPIO 32  | D32   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Toggle or cycle through LED colors with a push button.
- Play tones or sound effects through the speaker.
- Basic debounce or edge detection for the push button (if implemented).
